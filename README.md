# delta-trade-risk-forge

`delta-trade-risk-forge` packages a practical trading systems exercise in Zig. The emphasis is on deterministic behavior, a small public API, and examples that explain the tradeoffs.

## How I Read Delta Trade Risk Forge

The useful thing to inspect here is how the same score rule is represented in code, metadata, and examples. If those three pieces disagree, the audit script should make the drift visible.

## Main Behaviors

- Includes extended examples for fills, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents portfolio pressure tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.
- Adds a repository audit script that checks structure before running the language verifier.

## Problem Shape

The goal is to capture the core behavior in code and make the surrounding assumptions obvious. A reader should be able to run the verifier, open the fixtures, and understand why each decision was made.

## Repository Map

- `src`: primary implementation
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Internal Model

The core is a scoring model over demand, capacity, latency, risk, and weight. That keeps order state, risk checks, and fills in one explicit decision path. The threshold is 163, with risk penalty 7, latency penalty 3, and weight bonus 2. The Zig version uses compile-time constants and native test blocks for fast local checks.

## How To Run It

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Scenario Walkthrough

`examples/extended_cases.csv` adds six named cases. I kept the names plain so failures are easy to read in a terminal: baseline, pressure, surge, degraded, recovery, and boundary.

## Validation

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Known Edges

This code is local-first. It makes no claim about deployed usage and avoids credentials, hosted state, and environment-specific setup.

## Follow-Up Work

- Add malformed input fixtures so the failure path is as visible as the happy path.
- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add one more trading systems fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## Run It Locally

Install Zig and run the commands from the repository root. The project does not need credentials or a hosted service.
